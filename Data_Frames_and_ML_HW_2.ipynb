        "1. In AI, datasets are often very large and cannot be processed all at once as is done in the loop in the [Linear Regression using SGD notebook](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/blob/main/Week_2/01_linear_regression_sgd.ipynb). The data is instead randomly sampled in smaller _batches_ where each _batch_ contains `batch_size` inputs. How can you change the loop above to sample the dataset in smaller batches? Hint: Our `data` variable is a Pandas `DataFrame` object, search for \"how to sample a DataFrame\".\n",
        "2. As described above, learning rates that grow smaller over time can help find and get closer to global minima. In the loop in code [Linear Regression using SGD notebook](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/blob/main/Week_2/01_linear_regression_sgd.ipynb), our `learning_rate_m` and `learning_rate_b` are constant through the process of minimizing our parameters. How could you change the loop to reduce the learning rates over loop iterations? (this is called [learning rate decay](https://youtu.be/QzulmoOg2JE?si=3RZdptc4kLxskWze))\n",
        "3. Follow the example from the [Linear Regression using SGD notebook](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/blob/main/Week_2/01_linear_regression_sgd.ipynb) and build a loop that properly finds the centers of the 4 clusters using k-means in the [clustering notebook](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/blob/main/Week_2/02_clustering.ipynb).\n"
