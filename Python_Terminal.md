## How to Execute Python Code on a Mac

1. **Check Python Installation:** Open Terminal and check if Python is installed by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version` and pressing Enter. If Python is installed, it will display the installed version. If not, you'll need to [download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) from the official website.

2. **Open Terminal:** You can open Terminal either by searching for it in Spotlight Search or by navigating to `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal`.

3. **Navigate to the Directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python file is located. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/python/file
   ```

4. **Run Python File:** To execute a Python script, use either `python` or `python3`, followed by the name of your Python file:
   ```
   python your_script.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   python3 your_script.py
   ```
   Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python file.

5. **Using Python Interpreter:** You can also run Python interactively in Terminal by typing `python` or `python3` to start the Python interpreter. Then, you can directly enter Python commands.

Remember, if Python is installed but not in your system's PATH variable, you might need to specify the full path to the Python interpreter when running scripts.
