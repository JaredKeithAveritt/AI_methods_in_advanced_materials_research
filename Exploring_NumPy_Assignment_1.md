### Homework Assignment 1: Exploring NumPy
This assignment covers a range of NumPy functionalities including array creation, element manipulation, statistical analysis, array reshaping, slicing/indexing, universal functions, and encourages practical application through a challenge scenario. 

### Instructions

- Complete each task using NumPy and submit their Python code / Jupyter Notebook along with the outputs or results obtained.
- Provide comments or explanations within the code to demonstrate understanding.
- I Encorage you to use NumPy documentation or resources for assistance.
- Optionally, students can provide a brief explanation of their approach or any challenges faced during the tasks.

#### Task 1: Basic Operations

1. **Array Creation:** Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 1 to 9.
2. **Element Manipulation:** Replace all odd numbers in the matrix with -1.

#### Task 2: Statistical Analysis

1. **Mean and Standard Deviation:** Generate a random 1-D array of 50 elements. Compute the mean and standard deviation of this array.
2. **Correlation Coefficient:** Create two random 1-D arrays with 30 elements each and find the correlation coefficient between them.

#### Task 3: Array Manipulation

1. **Reshaping Arrays:** Create a 2-D array with 20 elements and reshape it into a 4x5 matrix.
2. **Slicing and Indexing:** Extract the middle row and middle column from the 4x5 matrix.

#### Task 4: Universal Functions

1. **Square Root:** Generate an array of 10 random integers and find the square root of each element.
2. **Trigonometric Functions:** Create an array of angles in radians and compute the sine, cosine, and tangent of each angle.

### Task 5: Custom Function Creation 

1. **Without NumPy:** Create a function named `calculate_area()` that determines the area of a circle based on its radius provided as an argument. Test this function by supplying various radius values and showcasing the corresponding calculated areas.
   
2. **With NumPy:** Modify the `calculate_area()` function to calculate the area of a circle using a NumPy array containing 10 random radius values as an argument. Evaluate this function by supplying diverse radius values and exhibiting the calculated areas accordingly.

#### Task 6: Additional Challenge (Optional)

Design a scenario where a student needs to perform an operation or analysis using NumPy and provide step-by-step instructions on how they would utilize NumPy to solve the problem. Encourage creativity and practical application.
