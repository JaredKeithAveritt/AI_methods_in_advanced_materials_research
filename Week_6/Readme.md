# Tutorial: Using Matminer for Machine Learning in Electronic Studies of Defective 2D Materials

## Introduction

This tutorial provides an introduction to using Matminer for machine learning applications in the study of defective 2D materials and material heterostructures. Matminer is a Python library for materials data mining, designed to facilitate the transition from raw material data to a machine learning model. This guide covers the installation of Matminer, data retrieval, preprocessing, and setting up a basic machine learning model.

## Installation

To install Matminer, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install Matminer using pip:

```markdown
pip install matminer
```

For more detailed installation instructions, visit the [Matminer GitHub page](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer).

## Data Retrieval

Matminer allows for easy retrieval of data from materials databases such as the Materials Project and Citrine's databases.

### Example:

```python
from mp_api.client import MPRester

with MPRester("your_api_key_here") as mpr:
    docs = mpr.materials.summary.search(material_ids=["mp-149"], fields=["structure"])
    structure = docs[0].structure
    # -- Shortcut for a single Materials Project ID:
    structure = mpr.get_structure_by_material_id("mp-149")
```

You will need to register to get an [API(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) from the [MP API Key] (https://materialsproject.org/api) 

get started here : [Using the MP](https://docs.materialsproject.org/downloading-data/using-the-api/getting-started)

https://api.materialsproject.org/docs

For more on data retrieval, see the [Matminer documentation](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/).

## Preprocessing Data

Once you have your data, you'll likely need to preprocess it to fit the needs of your machine learning model. This can include normalization, handling missing values, and feature selection.

### Example:

```python
from matminer.featurizers.base import MultipleFeaturizer
from matminer.featurizers import composition as cf

# Define a list of featurizers
featurizers = MultipleFeaturizer([
    cf.ElementProperty.from_preset("magpie"),
    cf.Stoichiometry(),
    cf.ValenceOrbital(props=["avg"])
])

# Apply the featurizers to your dataframe
features = featurizers.featurize_dataframe(df, col_id="material_id")
```

## Setting Up a Machine Learning Model

After preprocessing your data, the next step is to set up a machine learning model. We will use a simple linear regression model as an example, but the process is similar for more complex models.

### Example:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, df['band_gap'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial has covered the basics of using Matminer for machine learning in the context of electronic studies of 2D materials. By following the steps outlined above, you can start building your own models to explore and predict the properties of 2D materials.
