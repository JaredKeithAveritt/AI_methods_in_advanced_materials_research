# Access to UNC Computing Systems for UNCG and NC A&T Students

All UNCG and NC A&T students have access to two Linux-based computing systems free of charge:

1. **Dogwood**: This system offers 11,000 computing cores and is optimized for large, multi-node computational models. It's suitable for message passing (e.g., MPI) or hybrid (OpenMP + MPI) programming. For more information on Dogwood, [click here](https://help.rc.unc.edu/dogwood-cluster/).

2. **Long Leaf**: With 6500 conventional compute cores and 13,000 threads (with hyperthreading enabled), Longleaf is designed for memory and I/O intensive workloads. It's best for jobs requiring a large number of single compute hosts. For more details on Longleaf, [click here](https://help.rc.unc.edu/longleaf-cluster/).
