# Neural Networks in Python

This tutorial covers the basics of neural networks (aka "deep learning"), which is a technique within machine learning. We will learn about the mathematics of neural networks by building them "by hand." In next week's tutorial, we will learn about how to use the higher-level functions in the Python module TensorFlow. 

We'll start with an image classification problem in this notebook:
