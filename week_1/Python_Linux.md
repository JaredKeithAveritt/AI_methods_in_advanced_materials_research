#### To execute Python code on Linux, follow these steps:

### Using Terminal:
1. **Open Terminal:** Launch the terminal application on your Linux system.
2. **Navigate to Directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your Python file (if necessary).
3. **Run Python Script:** Enter `python filename.py` to execute the Python script named `filename.py`. Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of your Python file.

### Interactive Python Shell:
1. **Open Terminal:** Launch the terminal application.
2. **Enter Python Shell:** Type `python` or `python3` and press `Enter` to open the Python interactive shell.
3. **Execute Code:** Enter Python code directly into the shell and press `Enter` to run each line. For multiple lines of code, use a text editor and copy-paste the entire script into the shell.

### Using an IDE or Text Editor:
1. **Open IDE/Text Editor:** Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VSCode, PyCharm, or a text editor like Vim, Nano, or Emacs.
2. **Write Code:** Create or open a Python file (.py) within the IDE or text editor.
3. **Run Code:** Look for a "Run" button or use the command-line options within the IDE to execute the Python script.

Remember to ensure that Python is installed on your Linux system. You can check by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version` in the terminal. If Python isn't installed, you can install it using package managers like `apt` (Ubuntu, Debian) or `yum` (Red Hat, CentOS).

Always replace `filename.py` with the actual name of your Python file when running code.
