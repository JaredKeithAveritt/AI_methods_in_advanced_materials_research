# How to Execute Python Code Using Open OnDemand

Open OnDemand is a new method to access the Longleaf cluster, providing a web portal with a shell, file browser, and graphical interface for applications like Jupyter, MATLAB, and R.

Note: Ensure you have a **Longleaf account** before accessing Research Computing's Open OnDemand service.[CLICK HERE FOR INSTRUCTIONS](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/blob/main/other/Python_Chapel_Hill_Access.md)

1. **Accessing Open OnDemand**:
   Visit [https://ondemand.rc.unc.edu](https://ondemand.rc.unc.edu) in your web browser.
   Authenticate with your ONYEN/password.

2. **Interactive Apps**:
   Explore the pull-down menus for a File Browser, Job Builder, shell, and list of Interactive Apps.
   Under Interactive Apps, access servers like Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Launching a Server Application**:
   Request the server application you want to use.

4. **Specify Resources**:
   Fill out a form to specify job resources like duration, number of CPUs, etc. For instance, request one hour, one CPU, and optionally a 9GB memory limit.
   Click 'Launch' after completing the form.

5. **Launching the Job**:
   Upon job launch, you'll receive a notification that your job is queued. Depending on resources, your job will be scheduled within minutes.
   Choose your display settings and click 'Launch' for your preferred application, such as 'Connect to RStudio Server'.
