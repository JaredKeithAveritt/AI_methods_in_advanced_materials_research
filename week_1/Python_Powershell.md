## To execute Python code on a PC, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: If Python isn't already installed, [download and install it](https://www.python.org/) from the official website. During installation, ensure you check the option to add Python to PATH.

2. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**: You can open Command Prompt by typing "cmd" in the Windows search bar and pressing Enter. For PowerShell, type "powershell" and press Enter.

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python file is located. For example:
   ```
   cd path\to\your\python\file
   ```

4. **Run Python File**: To execute a Python script, type:
   ```
   python your_script.py
   ```
   Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python file.

5. **Using Python Interpreter**: You can also run Python interactively in the command prompt by typing `python` to start the Python interpreter. Then, you can directly enter Python commands.

Remember, if Python is not in your system's PATH variable, you might need to specify the full path to the Python interpreter when running scripts.
