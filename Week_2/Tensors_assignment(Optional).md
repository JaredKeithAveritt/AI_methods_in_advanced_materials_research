# Homework Assignment: Tensors and PyTorch

## Instructions:

1. Complete the following exercises to reinforce your understanding of tensors and their usage in PyTorch.

2. Ensure that you run your code and verify the results to check for correctness.

3. Submit your completed assignment according to the instructions provided.

### Exercise 1: Characteristics of Tensors

#### a) Rank and Shape

Create tensors with the following characteristics:

1. A tensor representing a scalar with the value 10.
2. A tensor representing a vector with values 1, 2, 3.
3. A tensor representing a matrix with values [[4, 5], [6, 7]].

#### b) Data Types

Create tensors with the following data types:

1. A tensor containing floating-point values [2.5, 3.7, 1.8].
2. A tensor containing integer values [5, 10, 15].

### Exercise 2: PyTorch Tensors

#### a) Creating Tensors

Use PyTorch to create tensors according to the following specifications:

1. A tensor using `torch.ones()` with a shape of (2, 3).
2. A tensor using `torch.arange()` to generate values from 1 to 5.

#### b) Operations on Tensors

Perform the following operations on tensors:

1. Create two matrices `tensor_d` and `tensor_e` with values [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and [[2, 3], [4, 5]] respectively. Add these matrices and print the result.
2. Multiply the tensor from Exercise 2a(2) by 3.

#### c) Tensor Indexing and Slicing

Manipulate tensors using indexing and slicing:

1. Index the element at position (1, 1) in the tensor `tensor_d`.
2. Slice the second column of `tensor_e`.

### Exercise 3: Applications in PyTorch

#### a) Neural Networks

Consider a simple neural network layer with input tensor `input_tensor` and weight tensor `weights_tensor`. Use PyTorch to compute the output tensor.

```python
input_tensor = torch.randn((3, 3))
weights_tensor = torch.randn((3, 2))
# Your code here to compute the output_tensor
```

#### b) GPU Acceleration

Perform GPU acceleration using PyTorch:

1. Move the tensor `tensor_e` to the GPU.
2. Add the GPU tensor to the tensor `tensor_d` and print the result.

#### c) Gradient Computation

Compute gradients for the following tensor `tensor_f`:

```python
tensor_f = torch.randn((2, 2), requires_grad=True)
loss = (tensor_f * tensor_f).sum()
# Your code here to compute and print the gradients
```
