# Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch

[In this notebook](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/edit/main/Week_4/01_pytorch_mnist.ipyn), we will use the PyTorch library to solve the same problem as in the last session. 
We will also further our knowledge of neural networks and deep learning through this hands-on example. In particular, we will discuss how to train and improve the learning capabilities.  

In our previous session, we addressed a supervised learning challenge by tackling a classification task with the MNIST dataset. We developed and trained a multi-layer perceptron model, a foundational neural network architecture, to recognize and classify handwritten digits. Our hands-on approach allowed us to gain practical experience in applying neural networks to real-world problems. For more details on our model from last week and the training process, you can explore our [multi-layer perceptron model project](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/edit/main/Week_3/01_introduction_mlp.ipynb).
