# Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch

[In today's notebook](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/edit/main/Week_4/01_pytorch_mnist.ipynb), we will use the PyTorch library to solve the same problem as in the last session. We will also further our knowledge of neural networks and deep learning through this hands-on example. In particular, we will discuss how to train and improve the learning capabilities.  

In our previous session, we addressed a supervised learning challenge by tackling a classification task with the MNIST dataset. We developed and trained a [multi-layer perceptron model](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/edit/main/Week_3/01_introduction_mlp.ipynb), a foundational neural network architecture, to recognize and classify handwritten digits.
