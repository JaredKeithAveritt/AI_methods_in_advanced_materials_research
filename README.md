## Course Syllabus: AI Methods in Advanced Materials Research

- **When:** Starting January 19th, 2024, Every Friday (during seminar days), 9:30 am, lasting 45 minutes per session (with additional time afterwards for questions), spanning around 10 weeks.

- **Where:** JSNN Auditorium.

- **Course Website:** [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/JaredKeithAveritt/AI_methods_in_advanced_materials_research/)

- **Description:** The course integrates AI methods into graduate-level research, focusing on material research. Topics covered include neural networks, large language models, machine learning, featurization, hyperparameter tuning, and introductory-level advanced analysis.

- **Instructor:** Jared Keith Averitt
  - Prefered Email: nanophysicist@icloud.com
  - UNCG Email: jkaveritt@uncg.edu 
  - Developed with guidance from Dr. Starobin and Dr. Ignatova.

- **Requirements:** Bring your laptop. You will not need to install anything to start. We will be using Jupyter notebooks through Google Colab. You will need a google account (your UNCG gmail will not work). The course begins with Python basics, progressing to large language models and convolutional neural networks. Moderate coding understanding (e.g., Matlab) is beneficial; extra Python learning resources will be provided.

- ### Python Crash Course (Additional Resources to get you up to date with Python)
- **[1.5 Hr -- Very Short Crash Course](https://youtu.be/JJmcL1N2KQs?si=V4ooqkGjR3quSa3o)**
- **[9h -- Basically a class on Python â€“ Starts from 0 Python Knowledge all the way to Pandas Data Frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPVsHOlRBBI)**
- **Both Recomended by Anna Sheets**

- **Expected Learning Outcomes:** Implementation of AI in research, handling experimental results in data frames using Pandas and Python, utilizing PyTorch, scikit-learn, and featurization tools.

- **Assignments:** Projects follow each lecture to test competency. Solutions are released before the subsequent lecture. Collaborative work is encouraged. Self-graded assignments with opportunities for guidance and feedback.
