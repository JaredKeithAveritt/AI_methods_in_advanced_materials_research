# Homework 1:

In this notebook, we've learned about some basic convolutional networks and trained one on CIFAR-10 images.  It did ... OK.  There is significant overfitting of this model.  There are some ways to address that, but we didn't have time to get into that in this session.

Meanwhile, your homework (part 1) for this week is to try to train the model again but with a different architecture.  Change one or more of the following:
- The number of convolutions between downsampling
- The number of filters in each layer
- The initial "patchify" layer
- Another hyper-parameter of your choosing

And compare your final validation accuracy to the accuracy shown here.  Can you beat the validation accuracy shown?

For full credit on the homework, you need to show (via text, or make a plot) the training and validation data sets' performance (loss and accuracy) for all the epochs you train.  You also need to explain, in several sentences, what you changed in the network and why you think it makes a difference.
